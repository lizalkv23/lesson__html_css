                           <p>Tony Stark, the son of a wealthy industrialist, was a brilliant inventor and mechanic. At
                              the age of 21, he inherited his father's business, turning the company into one of the
                              leading manufacturers of weapons. Stark was wounded in the chest by shrapnel during a
                              field test for the suitability of combat armor, which was supposed to endow soldiers with
                              combat abilities. Stark was captured by the gun baron Wong Chu, forcing him to create
                              weapons of mass destruction â€” only after that Tony would have the operation necessary to
                              save his life.</p>

                              after which at school he discovered in himself the power and abilities similar to spiders.
                              Soon he was able to crawl on walls and sense danger, and later even invented his own web
                              and a device for emitting it to move around on it. After Uncle Ben's death, in which Peter
                              himself was partly to blame, he realized what his uncle's words meant "with great power
                              comes great responsibility," after which he became Spider-Man</p>

                              Thor was stripped of his powers and banished to Earth by his father Odin, king of Asgard.
                              While in exile, Thor learned humility, fell in love with Dr. Jane Foster, and saved his
                              new friends from a destructive threat sent by his envious half-brother Loki, who dreams of
                              seizing the throne of Asgard. Thor was able to stop Loki, as a result of which he was
                              forgiven by Odin and received his power back.</p>
